A minimalist, modern landing page for 'Banana Wedding' optimized for Korean typography and readability.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (STRICT):**

- **Primary Colors**:
  - Banana Yellow: `#FBC02D` (Warmth, Joy, Brand Identity)
  - Toss Blue: `#3182F6` (Trust, Smart, Modernity - _User requested blue to be a primary accent_)
  - Clean White: `#FFFFFF` (Background, Clarity)
- **Typography (Korean Optimization)**:
  - Font: `Pretendard` or `Noto Sans KR`.
  - **Leading (Line Height)**: Relaxed (1.6 - 1.7) for body text to improve readability.
  - **Tracking (Letter Spacing)**: Tight (-0.02em to -0.03em) for headings to look modern and crisp.
- **Aesthetic**: "Super App" style (like Toss or Apple). Clean, airy, rounded corners (24px+), soft shadows, big bold typography.

**Structure:**

1.  **Header**: Transparent to white on scroll. Logo (Yellow/Blue/White combination).
2.  **Hero**: Large typography "완벽한 시작을 위하여" with refined spacing. Main visual that combines Blue and Yellow elements harmoniously.
3.  **Value Proposition**: Minimal grid using white cards with soft shadows.
4.  **Showcase**: Horizontal scroll or clean grid of mockups.
5.  **Footer**: Simple, clean link list.

**Technical Constraint:**
Use Tailwind classes but prioritize custom spacing for Korean text (e.g., `leading-[1.6]`, `tracking-[-0.02em]`).
